# Translator for KDE KRunner (Plasma 5)

This is a plugin for Plasma 5 KRunner. It's a translator and it translates text.

## Installation ##
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kf5-config --prefix` -DQT_PLUGIN_INSTALL_DIR=`kf5-config --qt-plugins`
make 
sudo make install
kquitapp krunner
krunner
```
## Configuration ##

The translation of sentences is done via [yandex](https://translate.yandex.com/). Therefore an api key is required. You have to obtain a key yourself by following these steps:  
1. Register at https://passport.yandex.com/  
2. Get a API key at https://tech.yandex.com/keys/get/?service=trnsl   
3. Copy the key to the configuration dialog  

If you do not provide an api key only the translation of single words will work.

Further, you can specify a primany and secondary language in the configuration dialog. You have to use the [ISO 639-1 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes), e.g., "en" and "de" for englisch and german, respectively. This simplifies the syntax. If no source language is specified, the primary language is used. If target and primary language are identical, than secondary language is used (see *Usage* for some examples). 



## Usage ##

A list of all language codes you can find [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).

### Specify source and target language ###
Syntax: \<sourcelang\>-\<targetlang\> \<searchterm\>  
*en-de house* → will translate *house* into german (*de*)

### Using primary and secondary language ###
Syntax: \<targetlang\> \<searchterm\>

Primary language: *en*  
Secondary language: *de*  

*de home* → *en-de home*  
*en blau* → *de-en blau*  
*fr maison* → *en-fr maison*
